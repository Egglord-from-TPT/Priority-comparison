# variables_plus

A simple Python library to create, clear, read and delete global variables.

This is my first python library :D

Commands:
vp.vp("create(variable=something)")   # Remove =something to create a blank variable.
vp.vp("clear(variable)")   # Leave clear() empty to clear all variables.
vp.vp("delete(variable)")
vp.vp("read(variable)")   # Doesn't print it. Use print(vp.vp("read(variable)")) to print the variables contents.
